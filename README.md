# Titanic App

A **React app** for exploring Titanic passenger data and analyzing survival outcomes. Visualize patterns, understand logistic regression models, and make predictions based on passenger characteristics.

## Features

- **Explore Data Patterns**  
  Visualize survival rates by **sex**, **age**, and **class**, and use **alluvial plots** to see how groups flow across categories.

- **Logistic Regression Models**  
  Compare models with different predictors and interpret **Odds Ratio** plots to see how each factor influences survival chances.

- **Make Predictions**  
  Input hypothetical passenger data (sex, age, class) to get predicted survival probabilities.

- **Evaluate Model Performance**  
  Check **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves** to understand model accuracy and discrimination.
